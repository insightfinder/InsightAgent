# New Relic

### Pre-requisites
This agent collects data from the New Relic API; it does not install the New Relic agent(s) itself.
Otherwise, the same set of pre-requisites applies as for other agents:
* `python`
* `python-utils` if using Python version 3+

## Installing the Agent
**Download the agent [tarball](https://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/raw/master/newrelic/newrelic.tar.gz) and untar it:**
```
curl -L https://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/raw/master/newrelic/newrelic.tar.gz -o newrelic.tar.gz
tar xvf newrelic.tar.gz && cd newrelic
```

**Copy `config.ini.template` to `config.ini` and edit it:**
```
cp config.ini.template config.ini
vi config.ini
```
See below for a further explanation of each variable.

**Setup pip & required packages:**
```
sudo ./pip-setup.sh
```

**Test the agent:**
```
python getmetrics_newrelic.py -t
```

**If satisfied with the output, configure the agent to run continuously:**
```
sudo ./cron-config.sh <sampling_interval>
```

### Config Variables
* **`api_key`**: API key for New Relic.
* `app_or_host`: APP, HOST, or BOTH, depending on what type of metrics to collect.
* `auto_create_project`: Set to `YES` to send data to a project based on the app name, which will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.
