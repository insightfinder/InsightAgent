#### Installation:

```
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/archive/master.tar.gz -O insightagent.tar.gz
or
wget --no-check-certificate http://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/archive/master.tar.gz -O insightagent.tar.gz
```

Untar using this command.
```
tar -xvf insightagent.tar.gz
cd InsightAgent-master/
```

2) Download the agent Code which will be distributed to other machines (not required if you have the offline installation package)
```
cd deployment/DeployAgent/files/
sudo -E ./downloadAgentSSL.sh
# or
sudo -E ./downloadAgentNoSSL.sh
```

3) Install Ansible if this the first agent you are installing from this machine.
```
cd ..
