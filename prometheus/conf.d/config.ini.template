# two formats: 1. prometheus query used to query several metrics. 2. string format like <metric_name>:<instance_fields>:<prometheus_query>.
# It can contains several queries, each query is separated by `;`.
# For example:
# {__name__=~".+"};metric_bytes:instance:rate(windows_net_bytes_sent_total[5m]);cpu_time_total::sum by (mode,instance) (irate(windows_cpu_time_total[5m]))
