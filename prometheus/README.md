# InsightAgent: Prometheus
Agent Type: prometheus

Platform: Linux

##### Instructions to register a project in Insightfinder.com
- Go to the link https://insightfinder.com/
- Sign in with the user credentials or sign up for a new account.
- Go to Settings and Register for a project under "Insight Agent" tab.
- Give a project name, select Project Type as "Metric" and Agent Type as "Custom".

### Prerequisites:
Python 2.7
SSH accesses to all hosts where agents will be installed are required. SSH key can be generated by following this link:
https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/

Tested with ansible version 2.4

### Install wget to download the required files :
#### For Debian and Ubuntu
```
sudo -E apt-get update
sudo -E apt-get install wget
```
#### For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives
```
sudo -E yum update
sudo -E yum install wget
```
Note: If you are using proxy, the proxy needs to be set for both the current user and root
#### Installation:
1) Use the following command to download the insightfinder agent code. You can skip this step if you have the offline installer package.
```
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/archive/master.tar.gz -O insightagent.tar.gz
or
wget --no-check-certificate http://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/archive/master.tar.gz -O insightagent.tar.gz

```
Untar using this command.
```
tar -xvf insightagent.tar.gz
```
```
cd InsightAgent-master/deployment/DeployAgent/
sudo -E ./installAnsible.sh
```
2) Open and modify the inventory file

```
[nodes]
HOST ansible_user=USER ansible_ssh_private_key_file=SOMETHING
###We can specify the host name with ssh details like this for each host
##If you have the ssh key
#192.168.33.10 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/private_key

##If you have the password
#192.168.33.20 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=ssh_password


##We can also specify the host names here and the ssh details under [nodes:vars] if they have have the same ssh credentials
##(Only one of ansible_ssh_pass OR ansible_ssh_private_key_file is required)
#192.168.33.10
#192.168.33.15

[nodes:vars]
#ansible_user=vagrant
#ansible_ssh_pass=ssh_password
#ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/private_key

[all:vars]
##install or uninstall
ifAction=install

##Login User In Insightfinder Application
ifUserName=

##Project Name In Insightfinder Application
ifProjectName=

##User's License Key in Application
ifLicenseKey=

##Sampling interval could be an integer indicating the number of minutes or "10s" indicating 10 seconds.
ifSamplingInterval=1

3) Download the agent Code which will be distributed to other machines(not required if you have the offline installation package)
```
cd files
sudo -E ./downloadAgentSSL.sh
or
sudo -E ./downloadAgentNoSSL.sh
```
4) Run the playbook(Go back to the DeployAgent directory)
```
cd ..
ansible-playbook insightagent.yaml
```

### Uninstallation:
Note: Uninstallation is required before you can install any other Metric agent(e.g. cgroup) or you want to reinstall the current collectd agent.

1) Open and modify the inventory file
```
[all:vars]
