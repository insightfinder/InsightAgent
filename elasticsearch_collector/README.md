# elasticsearch_collector
This agent collects data from elasticsearch and sends it to Insightfinder.
## Installing the Agent

### Before install agent
###### Install freetds for linux/osx
```bash
osx: brew install freetds
linux: yum install freetds
```

### Short Version
```bash
bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/master/utils/fetch-agent.sh) elasticsearch_collector && cd elasticsearch_collector
vi config.ini
sudo ./setup/install.sh --create  # install on localhost
                                  ## or on multiple nodes
sudo ./offline/remote-cp-run.sh list_of_nodes
```

See the `offline` README for instructions on installing prerequisites.

### Long Version
###### Download the agent tarball and untar it:
```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/insightfinder/InsightAgent/raw/master/elasticsearch_collector/elasticsearch_collector.tar.gz
tar xvf elasticsearch_collector.tar.gz && cd elasticsearch_collector
```

###### Set up `config.ini`
```bash
python configure.py
```
See below for a further explanation of each variable. 

#### Automated Install (local or remote)
###### Review propsed changes from install:
```bash
sudo ./setup/install.sh
```

###### Once satisfied, run:
```bash
sudo ./setup/install.sh --create
```

###### To deploy on multiple hosts, instead call 
```bash
sudo ./offline/remote-cp-run.sh list_of_nodes -f <nodelist_file>
```
Where `list_of_nodes` is a list of nodes that are configured in `~/.ssh/config` or otherwise reachable with `scp` and `ssh`.

#### Manual Install (local only)
###### Check Python version
Agent required Python 3 environment.

###### Setup pip & required packages:
```bash
sudo ./setup/pip-config.sh
```

###### Test the agent:
```bash
python getmessages_elasticsearch_collector.py -t
```

###### If satisfied with the output, configure the agent to run continuously:
```bash
sudo ./setup/cron-config.sh
```

* `indeces`: Indeces to search over (comma-separated, wildcards supported)
* `port`: Port to connect to for ES. Overridden if in URI
* `http_auth`: `username:password` used to connect to ES. Overridden if in URI
* `use_ssl`: True or False if SSL should be used. Overridden if URI scheme is `https`
* `ssl_assert_hostname`: True or False if hostname verification should be done
* `ssl_assert_fingerprint`: True or False if fingerprint verification should be done
* `ssl_version`: Version of SSL to use - one of `SSLv23 (default), SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1`
* `verify_certs`: True or False if certificates should be verified
* `ca_certs`: Path to CA bundle
* `client_cert`: Path to certificate
* `client_key`: Path to client
* `his_time_range`: History data time range, Example: 2020-04-14 00:00:00,2020-04-15 00:00:00. If this option is set, the agent will query metric values by time range.
* **`data_format`**: The format of the data to parse: RAW, RAWTAIL, CSV, CSVTAIL, XLS, XLSX, JSON, JSONTAIL, AVRO, or XML. \*TAIL formats keep track of the current file being read & the position in the file.
* `timestamp_format`: Format of the timestamp, in python [arrow](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-tokens). If the timestamp is in Unix epoch, this can be set to `epoch`. If the timestamp is split over multiple fields, curlies can be used to indicate formatting, ie: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ`; alternatively, if the timestamp can be in one of multiple fields, a priority list of field names can be given: `timestamp1,timestamp2`.
* `timezone`: Timezone of the timestamp data stored in/returned by the DB. Note that if timezone information is not included in the data returned by the DB, then this field has to be specified. 
* **`timestamp_field`**: Field name for the timestamp. Default is `timestamp`.
* `target_timestamp_timezone`: Timezone of the timestamp data to be sent and stored in InsightFinder. Default value is UTC. Only if you wish to store data with a time zone other than UTC, this field should be specified to be the desired time zone.
* `component_field`: Field name for the component name.
* `instance_field`: Field name for the instance name. If no instance given, the elasticsearch's server name will be used.
* `instance_whitelist`: This field is a regex string used to define which instances will be filtered.
* `device_field`: Field name for the device/container for containerized projects. This can also use a priority list, field names can be given: `device1,device2`.
* **`data_fields`**: Comma-delimited list of field names to use as data fields. If not set, all fields will be reported. Each data field can either be a field name (`name`) or a labeled field (`<name>::<value>`.
* `agent_http_proxy`: HTTP proxy used to connect to the agent.
* `agent_https_proxy`: As above, but HTTPS.
* **`user_name`**: User name in InsightFinder
* **`license_key`**: License Key from your Account Profile in the InsightFinder UI. 
* `token`: Token from your Account Profile in the InsightFinder UI. 
* **`project_name`**: Name of the project created in the InsightFinder UI. 
* **`project_type`**: Type of the project - one of `metric, metricreplay, log, logreplay, incident, incidentreplay, alert, alertreplay, deployment, deploymentreplay`.
* **`sampling_interval`**: How frequently (in Minutes) data is collected. Should match the interval used in project settings.
* **`run_interval`**: How frequently (in Minutes) the agent is ran. Should match the interval used in cron.
* `chunk_size_kb`: Size of chunks (in KB) to send to InsightFinder. Default is `2048`.
* `if_url`: URL for InsightFinder. Default is `https://app.insightfinder.com`.
* `if_http_proxy`: HTTP proxy used to connect to InsightFinder.
* `if_https_proxy`: As above, but HTTPS.
