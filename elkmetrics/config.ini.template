# metric_whitelist is a regex string used to define which metrics will be filtered. Metric name is connect with slash, EX: `{jvm: {mem: {non_heap_used_in_bytes: 1}}}` => `jvm/mem/non_heap_used_in_bytes`.

Use `::==` as a separator to treat `<value>` as a mathematical formula, which must be parseable by `eval()`.
